# passport_demand_ds4a
During the last two years, a local government entity has been facing issues regarding passport emission due to the copious amount of requests that were temporarily suspended during the nationwide lockdown of 2020 for COVID-19. The number of requests submitted has exceeded the institutional capacity, resulting in a myriad of unattended requests and the accumulation of petitions, complaints and claims (PCCs) from citizens with poor customer satisfaction. 

To solve this problem, an end-to-end web application built in Dash was deployed using Azure. With the use of this analytical tool, the entity can gain insights regarding the behavior of requests in an intuitive manner and forecast the forthcoming demand on a weekly basis. The tool also keeps track of the number of unclaimed and near expiry passports as part of their operations.
